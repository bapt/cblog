To migration from the old backend to the new backend:

in the data repository which won't be needed in the futur:

for file in *.txt; do                                                                                                                                                      <(14:59:04)>
     cp $file ${file%.txt}
     cblogctl add ${file%.txt} 
     rm ${file%.txt}
done

awk -F\| '{ print "cblogctl set "substr($1, 1, length($1) - 4)" ctime="$2 }'  entries.index  | sh

now your new cblog is ready to run
